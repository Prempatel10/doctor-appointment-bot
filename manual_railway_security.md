2. Navigate to your project: `charismatic-rebirth`
3. Go to Variables tab
4. Verify all environment variables are properly set

### 3. Monitor Deployment
```bash
# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs  

# View current variables
railway variables
```

## Security Verification ‚úÖ

Your current deployment shows:
- ‚úÖ Bot is running successfully
- ‚úÖ Google Sheets integration working
- ‚úÖ All credentials loaded from environment variables
- ‚úÖ No errors in deployment logs
- ‚úÖ HTTPS communication active

## Emergency Procedures üö®

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test Railway connection
railway whoami

# Check project status  
railway status

# View deployment logs
railway logs

# List environment variables (without values)
railway variables --help
```

## Security Best Practices ‚úÖ

Your deployment already follows these best practices:

- ‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: All secrets stored as env vars
- ‚úÖ **No Hardcoding**: No credentials in source code  
- ‚úÖ **Git Security**: All sensitive files in .gitignore
- ‚úÖ **Platform Security**: Railway's built-in encryption
- ‚úÖ **Access Control**: Proper authentication
- ‚úÖ **Monitoring**: Active log monitoring
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS**: Secure communication

## Conclusion üéâ

**Your Doctor Appointment Bot is already properly secured!** 

All sensitive data is:
- ‚úÖ Encrypted by Railway platform
- ‚úÖ Stored as environment variables
- ‚úÖ Excluded from version control
- ‚úÖ Protected from unauthorized access

The bot is running successfully and securely. No additional action required!
